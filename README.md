# TRIPBYDISTANCE
Bureau of Transportation Statistics mobility data during COVID-19 Pandemic
## Project Objective
The declaration of the COVID-19 Pandemic on on March 15th, 2020, resulted in most states issuing “stay at home” orders within the following months uphending typical travel cycles. Studying trips numbers and distances traveled from anonymized mobile devices before and during the years of the pandemic provides insights into public response to the lockdows and subsequent mobility trends as comfort and desirability to travel increased. 
## Data Set
•	State level data from Trips by Distance

•	United States Census Bureau Population Estimates 2019-2022
